I thrive in the intricate world of software, where databases quietly power operations, APIs create seamless connections, and server logic drives behind-the-scenes functionality. With a meticulous attention to detail, an unwavering commitment to efficiency, and a deep passion for security, I am dedicated to building robust, scalable backend solutions that underpin the digital experiences we depend on.

Driven by both my technical skills and a sense of responsibility, I aim to develop innovative and elegant solutions that address the challenges faced by marginalized communities, making a meaningful impact through my work.
