## Problem Statement
In response to the diverse parking needs of a university community comprising students, visitors, and employees, our project aimed to develop a comprehensive parking management application. The focal point of our endeavor was the design and implementation of a flexible database system capable of accommodating various user roles, including administrators, users, and parking agents. This system facilitated the issuance of parking permits and tickets, streamlining parking operations. Our primary objective was to craft an efficient backend system that minimized redundant data storage while passing a battery of test scenarios, ensuring robust functionality and reliability. Notably, we adhered to stringent quality standards, striving for 90% code coverage through thorough unit testing to guarantee the application's performance and stability.

## Solution Overview
An all-encompassing solution for streamlining parking management within university campuses. Leveraging Django, our RESTful API constitutes a sturdy backend infrastructure catering to diverse parking needs. Backed by a Maria DB Server database, our solution efficiently handles parking permits and tickets for students, visitors, and employees. This Java application promises to deliver a seamless user experience while tracking and visualizing parking activities, aiming to optimize campus parking operations.

### MariaDB Backend
Tables for various use cases were meticulously organized within the MariaDB backend, ensuring adherence to the Third Normal Form for optimal database efficiency.

### Unit Test Coverage
Using JUnit and Mockito, a comprehensive suite of unit tests was constructed to evaluate the functionality of the system, achieving a remarkable 90% coverage of the code base with successful test case outcomes.

### Java Command Line Application
A Java-based front end was developed for the application, featuring a user-friendly menu system designed for effortless navigation and interaction.
