## Problem Statement

This project addresses the complexities of Natural Language Inference (NLI), a key component of language understanding. While focusing on NLI, we explored the broader implications of the task on general language comprehension. The project raised concerns about the potential limitations in generalizing the findings due to its narrow focus on NLI. We scrutinized the underlying assumptions in detecting entailment and contradiction, recognizing the risk of oversimplifying real-world NLI scenarios, which could hinder the model's ability to handle diverse linguistic constructs and subtle contextual nuances.

## Solution Overview

To tackle the challenges posed by NLI, we employed BERT, a state-of-the-art transformer model, to explore the nuances of language inference. Our approach included an in-depth examination of the hypotheses and methodologies used in training and evaluating the model. We focused on external validation and iterative refinement to ensure that the model remained adaptable to diverse linguistic contexts and could handle real-world applications effectively. The emphasis was on transparency, ensuring stakeholders understood the decision-making process of the model, and promoting responsible deployment practices.

### Methodological Considerations

Our study highlighted potential limitations in combining neutral and contradiction labels, which might oversimplify the relationships between sentences. We examined the implications of relying on BERT's architecture, particularly its capacity to handle the specific challenges inherent in NLI tasks.

### External Validation & Iterative Refinement

We established an external validation framework to test the model's adaptability to real-world scenarios and diverse datasets. This approach emphasized the importance of practical performance metrics like precision and recall over traditional academic metrics. Additionally, we adopted an iterative refinement process, continuously evaluating and refining the model to improve its performance over time.

### Transparency & Responsible Deployment

Transparency played a critical role in this project. We aimed to define clear reporting standards, documenting the model's limitations, assumptions, and potential biases. This transparency fosters trust and ensures stakeholders can responsibly deploy the model across various applications, understanding the multifaceted nature of NLI tasks.
