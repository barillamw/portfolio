## Problem Statement
Inefficient and labor-intensive manual plant care practices necessitate a solution that optimizes resource usage and minimizes human intervention, prompting the development of a plant automation system leveraging C programming for control, Python-based web servers for scheduling, and Kotlin applications for user interface, aiming to streamline cultivation processes while maximizing productivity and sustainability.

## Solution Overview
The proposed solution is a comprehensive plant automation system designed to streamline cultivation processes through the integration of C++ programming, Python-based web servers, and Kotlin applications. By leveraging C++ programming, precise control of environmental factors such as lighting and water distribution is achieved, ensuring optimal growing conditions. The Python-based web servers facilitate scheduling automation, allowing for remote monitoring and adjustment of cultivation parameters. Additionally, the Kotlin application provides a user-friendly interface for intuitive management and control of the system. Together, these components create an efficient and sustainable solution to automate plant care, reducing labor requirements and maximizing productivity.
